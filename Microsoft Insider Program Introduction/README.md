## Introduction

The Microsoft Insider Program is similar to the **volunteer program**. It has been translated into the **"Microsoft Testers Program"** in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Microsoft product enthusiasts who sign up for the program are called **"Microsoft Insider"** (or Microsoft Tester), and **they will get the latest features, news, and updates from Microsoft first**. Also, Insiders can learn about the future of Microsoft products before the general public, provide direct feedback to Microsoft employees (including engineers), and jointly shape the future of their favorite Microsoft products.

## Are the qualifications/conditions required to register the Program?

The Microsoft Insider Programs are primarily open to Microsoft product enthusiasts, not just computer professionals. **Therefore, the participating users do not need to have the high-level computer-related technical ability**.

Before signing up for any preview program, **be sure to carefully read the legal agreement** that will constitute a legal agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live, or if a business, where your principal place of business is located, one of its affiliates) and governs your participation in the Program that.

For example, if you want to sign up for the **Windows Insider Program**, here are **four** things to watch out for:

1. You understand that using experimental and early pre-release software means you may experience occasional crashes and data loss. By participating, you agree to frequently backup your data.
2. Your Program participation is voluntary and free, there is no compensation for your participation. Your participation does not create a legal partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and Microsoft.
3. By signing-up to participate in the Program, you represent you are the legal age of “majority” where you live and agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement which is required for you to participate in the Program.
4. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of any Software except and only to the extent that the foregoing restriction is (a) permitted by applicable law; (b) permitted by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the software; or (c) required to debug changes to any libraries licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License which are included with and linked to by the software.

The above four agreements can be briefly summarized as follows:

1. **Users need to be adults to participate in the Windows Insider Program.**
2. **The Insider Program provides the user with software that may damage the user's device.**
3. **Users will not be paid or have any employment relationship with Microsoft.**
4. **Users are not allowed to decompile software provided by Microsoft or attempt to export its source code in any way.**

The above is from the Windows Insider Program agreement, only a small part of the entire protocol, for your reference. The legal agreement for different Microsoft preview experience plans is different. **You must read the corresponding agreement carefully before signing up for any Microsoft preview experience plan to avoid any actions that violate the agreement**.
