# Microsoft Insider Programs

***Empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.***

For a long time, I firmly believe that **if a large project is to succeed, it cannot be achieved by one member of the team alone, but by the mutual help and joint efforts of each member of the team.** ***A single flower does not make a spring.*** In the more than two years of participating in the Microsoft Insider Program, I have won the top 10 of the Windows Insider Leaderboard several times, and I have accumulated some shallow experience. I have believed that **the hard work of a small group of members will not make the Microsoft Insider Program *"Spring Scenery Garden."* Rather than go it alone, I hope that through my efforts, the community can achieve the goal of *"All Flowers Bloom Together."***
 
So I decided to create this repository to record my contributions and lessons learned during my participation in the Microsoft Insider Program. I hope this repository can help newbie Microsoft Insiders fight for fewer detours and focus on contributing to Microsoft.

Thanks for your support!

# Self Introduction

I am very into the corporate culture and technologies of Microsoft, and I have been committed to enabling more comfortable experiences for the users of Microsoft products. In terms of "promoting the rapid development of Windows and other Microsoft products," I have made the following contributions:

1. More than **470** feedbacks about Microsoft Windows and Edge were submitted, earning me over **5000** affirmative votes.

2. By acting as a Microsoft Community Independent Advisor, I have provided technical support to more than **6700** users of Microsoft products, with a total of more than **13,000** replies and customer satisfaction of more than **95%**.

3. I volunteered to translate the update notifications of Windows Insider Preview versions into Chinese before posting them on Microsoft Community and some popular social platforms (such as Zhihu, Weibo, and more) of China for tens of thousands of Windows Insiders in China to read. Ever since the release of Build 18890, I have translated **dozens** of English update notifications of Windows Insider Preview versions into Chinese.

Looking into 2020, I would continue to make further contributions to the development of Microsoft products. I believe that with the constant efforts of Microsoft fans and everyone else, there would be a day for Microsoft to live up to its lofty mission of **"Empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more."**

Thanks for your support!

### Where is other Insider Program?

I only conducted a superficial study of the Insider Program of Microsoft's Windows and Edge products and did not investigate other Insider Programs. **Without an investigation, there is no right to speak**. I cannot comment on the Insider Program that I have not known. Thank you for your understanding!

If I find other Microsoft product enthusiasts' introduction articles or experience summaries about Microsoft Insider Program, I will supplement the relevant links or content as much as possible below the license requirements.

**Thanks for your support!**
