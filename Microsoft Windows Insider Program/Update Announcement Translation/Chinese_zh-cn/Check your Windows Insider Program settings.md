# Check your Windows Insider Program settings

 With the Windows 10 May 2019 Update being shared to the Release Preview ring soon (see this blog post for details), we’re planning to move Windows Insiders in the Fast ring forward to 20H1. We will also be merging the small group of Insiders who opted-in to Skip Ahead back into the Fast ring. We are looking to make this change in the coming weeks. Now is the time for you to verify your desired Windows Insider Program settings by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program to ensure you’re on the ring you want to be on before this change occurs. If you are an Insider who wishes to remain on the May 2019 Update – you will want to switch to the Slow ring now or the Release Preview ring once it receives the May 2019 Update.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 20H1 builds are from our development branch (RS_PRERELEASE) and as is normal with builds early in the development cycle, these builds may contain bugs that might be painful for some. If you are in the Fast ring and your PC gets updated to 20H1, you won’t be able to switch your ring to the Slow or Release Preview rings without doing a clean-install on your PC and starting over.

We will begin releasing 19H2 bits to Insiders later this spring and will talk more about what that will look like in the near future.
