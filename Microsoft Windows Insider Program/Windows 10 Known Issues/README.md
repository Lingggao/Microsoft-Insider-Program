# Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903_18362) Known Issues and Processing Progress Summary [Deprecated]

Windows 10 version 1903 was officially released on May 21, 2019. When it was officially released, there were still a large number of problems. When Windows releases feature updates, product users know the least amount of information at this time, so serious negative public opinion may occur. I had anticipated this a week before the product was officially released. **As a glorious Microsoft Windows Insider, I thought I should come forward**.

In summary, in order to prevent Chinese Windows users from being impressed with the poor quality of Microsoft products because they can't get the latest information on the progress of bug handling, I created ***"Windows 10 May 2019 Update (1903_18362) Known Issues and Processing Progress Summary"*** discussion in Microsoft Community on **May 14, 2019 (one week before the official release)**.
